# action-gh-push

[![Build Status](https://github.com/justjavac/action-gh-push/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/justjavac/action-gh-push/actions)

> A GitHub Action for pushing to a repo.

## ü§∏ Usage

Below is a simple example of `step.if` tag gating

```yaml
name: ci

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Release
        uses: justjavac/action-gh-push@v1
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          files: |
            target/release/dvm-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip
            target/release/dvm-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.zip
            target/release/dvm-x86_64-apple-darwin.zip
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Notice the `|` in the yaml syntax above ‚òùÔ∏è. That let's you effectively declare a multi-line yaml string. You can learn more about multi-line yaml syntax [here](https://yaml-multiline.info)

| `fail_on_unmatched_files` | Boolean | Indicator of whether to fail if any of the `files` globs match nothing|
